OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
A programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions.

According Java Point of view: Object Oriented Programming is a method of programming where code is designed and based on the function and attributes of the objects.

variable = properties
function = methods
class = A template or a blueprint for creating objects

4 Pillars of Object-oriented Programming

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphaism  = Poly: Many, morphaism: form


1. Encapsulation = Reduce complexity + increase reusability 
2. Abstraction = Reduce comlexity + isolate impact of changes
3. Inheritance = Eliminate redundant code
4. Polymorphaism = Refactor ugly switch/case statements


Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, is the paradigm for modern application development. it is supported by major languages like JavaScript, Java or C#.

1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the ability of an object to be a container (or capsule) for its member properties, including variables and methods.
